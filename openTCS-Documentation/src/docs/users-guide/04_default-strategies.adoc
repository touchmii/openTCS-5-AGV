== Default strategies

openTCS comes with a default implementation for each of the strategy modules.
These implementations can easily be replaced to adapt to project-specific requirements.
(See developer's guide.)

=== Default dispatcher

When either a transport order or a vehicle becomes available, the dispatcher needs to decide what should happen with which transport order and which vehicle should do what.
To make this decision, the default dispatcher takes the following steps:

. New transport orders are prepared for processing.
  This includes checking general routability and unfinished dependencies.
. Updates of processes that are currently active are performed.
  This includes:
** Withdrawals of transport orders
** Successful completion of transport orders
** Assignment of subsequent transport orders for vehicles that are processing order sequences
. Vehicles that are currently unoccupied are assigned to processable transport orders, if possible.
** Criteria for a vehicle to be taken into account are:
*** It must be at a known position in the driving course.
*** It may not be assigned to a transport order, or the assigned transport order must be _dispensable_.
    That is the case with parking orders, for instance, or with recharging orders if the vehicle's energy level is not critical.
*** Its energy level must not be critical.
** Criteria for a transport order to be taken into account are:
*** It must be generally dispatchable.
*** It must not be part of an order sequence that is already being processed by a vehicle.
** The assignment mechanics are as following:
*** If there are less unoccupied vehicles than processable transport orders, the list of vehicles is sorted by configurable criteria.
    The default dispatcher then iterates over the sorted list and, for every vehicle, finds all orders processable by it, computes the required routes, sorts the candidates by configurable criteria and assigns the first one.
*** If there are less processable transport orders than unocuppied vehicles, the list of transport orders is sorted by configurable criteria.
    The default dispatcher then iterates over the sorted list and, for every transport order, finds all vehicles that could process it, computes the required routes, sorts the candidates by configurable criteria and assigns the first one.
*** For configuration options regarding the sorting criteria, see <<Default dispatcher configuration entries>>.
. Vehicles that are still unoccupied are sent to a recharging location, if possible.
** Criteria for a vehicle to be taken into account are:
*** It must be at a known position in the driving course.
*** Its energy level is _degraded_.
. Vehicles that are still unoccupied are sent to a parking position, if possible.
** Criteria for a vehicle to be taken into account are:
*** It must be at a known position in the driving course.
*** It must not be at a parking position already.

==== Default parking position selection

When sending a vehicle to a parking position, the closest (according to the router) unoccupied position is selected by default.
It is possible to assign fixed positions to vehicles instead, by setting properties with the following keys on them:

* `tcs:preferredParkingPosition`:
  Expected to be the name of a point in the model.
  If this point is already occupied, the closest unoccupied parking position (if any) is selected instead.
* `tcs:assignedParkingPosition`:
  Expected to be the name of a point in the model.
  If this point is already occupied, the vehicle is not sent to any other parking position, i.e. remains where it is.
  Takes precedence over `tcs:preferredParkingPosition`.

==== Optional parking position priorities

Optionally (see <<Default dispatcher configuration entries>> for how to enable it), parking positions may be explicitly prioritized, and vehicles can be reparked in a kind of "parking position queues".
This can be desirable e.g. to park vehicles close to locations that are frequent first destinations for transport orders.
(For example, imagine a plant in which goods are transported from A to B all the time.
Even if there currently aren't any transport orders, it might nevertheless be a good idea to prefer parking positions near A to reduce reaction times when transport orders arrive.)

To assign a priority to a parking position, set a property with the key `tcs:parkingPositionPriority` on the point.
The property's value should be a decimal integer, with lower values resulting in a higher priority for the parking position.

==== Default recharging location selection

When sending a vehicle to a recharge location, the closest (according to the router) unoccupied position is selected by default.
It is possible to assign fixed positions to vehicles instead, by setting properties with the following keys on them:

* `tcs:preferredRechargeLocation`:
  Expected to be the name of a location.
  If this location is already occupied, the closest unoccupied recharging location (if any) is selected instead.
* `tcs:assignedRechargeLocation`:
  Expected to be the name of a location.
  If this location is already occupied, the vehicle is not sent to any other recharging location.
  Takes precedence over `tcs:preferredRechargeLocation`.

=== Default router

The default router finds the cheapest route from one position in the driving course to another one.
(It uses an implementation of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm[Dijkstra's algorithm] to do that.)
It takes into account paths that have been locked, but not positions and/or assumed future behaviour of other vehicles.
As a result, it does not route around slower or stopped vehicles blocking the way.

==== Cost functions

The cost function used for evaluating the paths in the driving course can be selected via configuration -- see <<Default router configuration entries>>.
The following cost functions/configuration options are available:

* `DISTANCE`:
  Routing costs are equal to the paths' lengths.
* `TRAVELTIME`:
  Routing costs are computed as the expected time to travel on the paths, i.e. as path length divided by maximum allowed vehicle speed.
* `EXPLICIT_PROPERTIES`:
  Routing costs for a vehicle on a path are taken from path properties with keys `tcs:routingCostForward<GROUP>` and `tcs:routingCostReverse<GROUP>`.
  The `<GROUP>` to be used is the vehicle's routing group (see below).
  As an example, if a vehicle's routing group is "Example", routing costs for this vehicle would be taken from path properties with keys `tcs:routingCostForwardExample` and `tcs:routingCostReverseExample`.
  This way, different routing costs can be assigned to a path, e.g. for different types of vehicles. +
  Note that, for this cost function to work properly, the values of the routing cost properties should be decimal integers.

The default cost function for a path simply evaluates to the path's length, so the cheapest route by default is the shortest one.

==== Routing groups

It is possible to treat vehicles in a plant differently when computing their routes.
This may be desirable if they have different characteristics and actually have different optimal routes through the driving course.
For this to work, the paths in the model or the cost function used need to reflect this difference.
This isn't done by default -- the default router computes routes for all vehicles the same way unless told otherwise.
To let the router know that it should compute routes for a vehicle separately, set a property with the key `tcs:routingGroup` to an arbitrary string.
(Vehicles that have the same value set share the same routing table, and the empty string is the default value for all vehicles.)

=== Default scheduler

The default scheduler implements a simple strategy for traffic management.
It does this by allowing only mutually exclusive use of resources in the plant model (points and paths, primarily), as described below.

==== Allocating resources

When an allocation of a set of resources for a vehicle is requested, the scheduler performs the following checks to determine whether the allocation can be granted immediately:

. Check if the requested resources are generally available for the vehicle.
. Check if the requested resources are part of a block with the type `SINGLE_VEHICLE_ONLY`.
  If not, skip this check.
  If yes, expand the requested resource set to the effective resource set and check if the expanded resources are available for the vehicle.
. Check if the requested resources are part of a block with the type `SAME_DIRECTION_ONLY`.
  If not, skip this check.
  If yes, check if the direction in which the vehicle intends to traverse the block is the same the block is already being traversed by other vehicles.

If all checks succeed, the allocation is made.
If any of the checks fail, the allocation is queued for later.

==== Freeing resources

Whenever resources are freed (e.g. when a vehicle has finished its movement to the next point and the vehicle driver reports this to the kernel), the allocations waiting in the queue are checked (in the order the requests happened).
Any allocations that can now be made are made.
Allocations that cannot be made are kept waiting.

==== Fairness of scheduling

This strategy ensures that resources are used when they are available.
It does not, however, strictly ensure fairness/avoid starvation:
Vehicles waiting for allocation of a large resource set may theoretically wait forever if other vehicles can keep allocating subsets of those resources continuously.
Such situations are likely a hint at problems in the plant model graph's topology, which is why this deficiency is considered acceptable for the default implementation.
