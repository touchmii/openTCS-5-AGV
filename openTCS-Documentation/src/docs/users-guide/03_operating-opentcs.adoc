=== Starting the system

To create or to edit the plant model of a transport system, the openTCS Plant Overview application has to be started in modelling mode.
To use it as a transportation control system based on an existing plant model, it has to be started in plant operation mode.
Starting a component is done by executing the respective Unix shell script (`\*.sh`) or Windows batch file (`*.bat`).
By adjusting the Plant Overview's configuration entry `initialMode` to `OPERATING` or `MODELLING` you can automatically start in the specific mode (see <<Plant Overview configuration>>).

==== Starting in modelling mode

. Start the plant overview client (`startPlantOverview.bat/.sh`) 
+
By default it is configured to start in 'Modelling mode'.
. The plant overview will start with a new, empty model, but you can also load a model from a file (btn:[menu:File[Load Model]]) or the current kernel model (btn:[menu:File[Load current kernel model]]).
The latter option requires a running kernel that the Plant Overview client can connect to and that has loaded an existing plant model.
. Use the graphical user interface of the plant overview client to create an arbitrary driving course for your respective application/project.
How you can add elements like points, paths and vehicles to your driving course is explained in detail in <<Constructing a new plant model>>.

==== Starting in plant operation mode

. Start the kernel (`startKernel.bat/.sh`).
.. If this is your first time running the kernel, you need to persist the current plant model first.
Select btn:[menu:File[Persist model in the kernel]] in the plant overview (also see <<Saving the plant model>>).
. Start the kernel control center client (`startKernelControlCenter.bat/.sh`)
. Start the plant overview client (`startPlantOverview.bat/.sh`)
..  Switch the plant overview client to 'Operating mode' (btn:[menu:File[Mode > Operating mode]]).
. Select the tab btn:[Vehicle driver] in the kernel control center client.
Then select, configure and start driver for each vehicle in the model.
.. The list on the left-hand side of the window shows all vehicles in the chosen model.
.. A detailed view for a vehicle can be seen on the right-hand side of the driver panel after double-clicking on the vehicle in the list.
The specific design of this detailed view depends on the driver associated with the vehicle.
Usually, status information sent by the vehicle (e.g. current position and mode of operation) is displayed and low-level settings (e.g. for the vehicle's IP address) are provided here.
.. Right-clicking on the list of vehicles shows a popup menu that allows to attach drivers for selected vehicles.
.. For a vehicle to be controlled by the system, a driver needs to be attached to the vehicle and enabled.
(For testing purposes without real vehicles that could communicate with the system, the so-called loopback driver can be used, which provides a virtual vehicle or simulates a real one.)
How you attach and enable a vehicle driver is explained in detail in <<Configuring vehicle drivers>>.

=== Constructing a new plant model

These instructions roughly show how a new plant model is created and filled with driving course elements so that it can eventually be used in plant operation mode.

==== Starting components for plant modelling

. Start the plant overview client (`startPlantOverview.bat/.sh`) and select 'Modelling mode'.
. Wait until the graphical user interface of the plant overview client is shown.
. You can now add driving course components to the empty model. Whenever you want to start over, select btn:[menu:File[New Model]] from the main menu.

==== Adding elements to the plant model

.Control elements in the plant overview client (modelling mode)

. Create three points by selecting the point tool from the driving course elements toolbar (see red frame in the screenshot above) and click on three positions on the drawing area.
. Link the three points with paths to a closed loop by
.. selecting the path tool by double-click.
.. clicking on a point, dragging the path to the next point and releasing the mouse button there.
. Create two locations by double-clicking the location tool and clicking on any two free positions on the drawing area.
As a location type does not yet exist in the plant model, a new one is created implicitly when creating the first location, which can be seen in the tree view to the left of the drawing area.
. Link the two locations with (different) points by
.. double-clicking on the link tool.
.. clicking on a location, dragging the link to a point and releasing the mouse button.
. Create a new vehicle by clicking on the vehicle button in the course elements toolbar.
. Define the allowed operations for vehicles at the newly created locations by
.. selecting the locations' type in the tree view to the left of the drawing area (see blue frame in the screenshot above).
.. clicking the value cell labelled `"Actions"` in the property window below the tree view.
.. entering the allowed locations as arbitrary text in the dialog shown, for instance `"Load cargo"` and `"Unload cargo"`.
.. Optionally, you can choose a symbol for locations of the selected type by editing the property `"Symbol"`.

IMPORTANT: You will not be able to create any transport orders and assign them to vehicles unless you create locations in your plant model, link these locations to points in the driving course and define the operations that vehicles may execute with the respective location types.

==== Saving the plant model

You have two options to save the model: on your local hard drive or in a running kernel instance the plant overview is connected to.

===== Saving the model locally

Select btn:[menu:File[Save Model]] or btn:[menu:File[Save Model As...]] and enter an arbitrary name for the model.

===== Persisting the model in a running kernel

Select btn:[menu:File[Persist model in the kernel]] and your model will be persisted in the kernel, letting you switch to the operating mode.
This, though, requires you to save it locally first.
Note that the model that was previously persisted in the kernel will be replaced, as the kernel can only keep a single model at a time.

=== Operating the plant

These instructions explain how the newly created model that was persisted in the kernel can be used in plant operation mode, how vehicle drivers are used and how transport orders can be created and processed by a vehicle.

==== Starting components for system operation

. Start the kernel (`startKernel.bat/.sh`).
. Start the kernel control center client (`startKernelControlCenter.bat/.sh`).
. Start the plant overview client (`startPlantOverview.bat/.sh`), wait until its graphical user interface is shown and switch it to 'Operating mode'.

==== Configuring vehicle drivers

. Switch to the kernel control center client.
. Associate the vehicle with the loopback driver by right-clicking on the vehicle in the vehicle list of the driver panel and selecting the menu entry btn:[menu:Driver[Loopback adapter (virtual vehicle)]].
. Open the detailed view of the vehicle by double-clicking on the vehicle's name in the list.
. In the detailed view of the vehicle that is now shown to the right of the vehicle list, select the tab btn:[Loopback options].
. Enable the driver by ticking the checkbox btn:[Enable loopback adapter] in the btn:[Loopback options] tab or the checkbox in the btn:[Enabled?] column of the vehicle list.
. In the loopback options tab or in the vehicles list, select a point from the plant model to have the loopback adapter report this point to the kernel as the (virtual) vehicle's current position.
(In a real-world application, a vehicle driver communicating with a real vehicle would automatically report the vehicle's current position to the kernel as soon as it is known.)
. Switch to the plant overview client.
An icon representing the vehicle should now be shown at the point on which you placed it using the loopback driver.
. Right-click on the vehicle and select btn:[menu:Context menu[Change integration level > ...to utilize this vehicle for transport orders]] to allow the kernel to dispatch the vehicle.
The vehicle is then available for processing orders, which is indicated by an integration level `TO_BE_UTILIZED` in the property panel at the bottom left of the plant overview client's window.
(You can revert this by right-clicking on the vehicle and selecting btn:[menu:Context menu[Change integration level > ...to respect this vehicle's position]] in the context menu.
The integration level shown is now `TO_BE_RESPECTED` and the vehicle will not be dispatched for transport orders any more.)

==== Creating a transport order

To create a transport order, the plant overview client provides a dialog window presented when selecting btn:[menu:Actions[Transport Order]] in the menu.
Transport orders are defined as a sequence of destination locations at which actions are to be performed by the vehicle processing the order.
You can select a destination location and action from a dropdown menu.
You may also optionally select the vehicle intended to process this order.
If none is explicitly selected, the control system automatically assigns the order to a vehicle according to its internal strategies - with the default strategy, it will pick the vehicle that will most likely finish the transport order the soonest.
You may also optionally select or define a type for the transport order to be created.
Furthermore, a transport order can be given a deadline specifying the point of time at which the order should be finished at the latest.
This deadline will primarily be considered when there are multiple transport orders in the pool and openTCS needs to decide which to assign next.

To create a new transport order, do the following:

. Select the menu entry btn:[menu:Actions[Transport Order]].
. In the dialog shown, click the btn:[Add] button and select a location as the destination and an operation which the vehicle should perform there.
You can add an arbitrary number of destinations to the order this way.
They will be processed in the given order.
. After creating the transport order with the given destinations by clicking btn:[OK], the kernel will check for a vehicle that can process the order.
If a vehicle is found, it is assigned the order immediately and the route computed for it will be highlighted in the plant overview client.
The loopback driver simulates the vehicle's movement to the destinations and the execution of the operations.

==== Withdrawing transport orders using the plant overview client

A transport order can be withdrawn from a vehicle that is currently processing it.
When withdrawing a transport order, its processing will be cancelled and the vehicle (driver) will not receive any further movement commands for it.
A withdrawal can be issued by right-clicking on the respective vehicle in the plant overview client, selecting btn:[menu:Context menu[Withdraw transport order]] and then selecting one of the following actions:

* '...and let the vehicle finish movement':
  The vehicle will process any movement commands it has already received and will stop after processing them.
  This type of withdrawal is what should normally be used for withdrawing a transport order from a vehicle.
* '...and stop the vehicle immediately':
  In addition to what happens in the case of a "normal" withdrawal, the vehicle is also asked to discard all movement commands it has already received.
  (This _should_ make it come to a halt very soon in most cases.
  However, if and how far exactly it will still move highly depends on the vehicle's type, its current situation and how communication between openTCS and this type of vehicle works.)
  Furthermore, all reservations for resources on the withdrawn route (i.e. the next paths and points) except for the vehicle's currently reported position are cancelled, making these resources available to other vehicles.
  This "immediate" withdrawal should be used with great care and usually only when the vehicle is currently _not moving_!

CAUTION: Since an "immediate" withdrawal frees paths and points previously reserved for the vehicle, it is possible that other vehicles acquire and use these resources themselves right after the withdrawal.
At the same time, if the vehicle was moving when the withdrawal was issued, it may - depending on its type - not have come to a halt, yet, and still move along the route it had previously been ordered to follow.
As the latter movement is not coordinated by openTCS, this can result in a _collision or deadlock_ between the vehicles!
For this reason, it is highly recommended to issue an "immediate" withdrawal only if it is required for some reason, and only if the vehicle has already come to a halt on a position in the driving course or if other vehicles need not be taken into account.
In all other cases, the "normal" withdrawal should be used.

Processing of a withdrawn transport order _cannot_ be resumed later.
To resume a transportation process that was interrupted by withdrawing a transport order, you need to create a new transport order, which may, of course, contain the same destinations as the withdrawn one.
Note, however, that the new transport order may not be created with the same name.
The reason for this is:

a. Names of transport orders need to be unique.
b. Withdrawing a transport order only aborts its processing, but does not remove it from the kernel's memory, yet.
   The transport order data is kept as historical information for a while before it is completely removed.
   (For how long the old order is kept depends on the kernel application's configuration -- see <<Order pool configuration entries>>.)

As a result, a name used for a transport order may eventually be reused, but only after the actual data of the old order has been removed.

==== Continuous creation of transport orders

NOTE: The plant overview client can easily be extended via custom plugins.
As a reference, a simple load generator plugin is included which also serves as a demonstration of how the system looks like during operation here.
Details about how custom plugins can be created and integrated into the plant overview client can be found in the developer's guide.

. In the plant overview client, select btn:[menu:View[Plugins > Continuous load]] from the menu.
. Choose a trigger for creating new transport orders:
New orders will either be created once only, or if the number of active orders in the system drops below a specified limit, or after a specified timeout has expired.
. By using an order profile you may decide if the transport orders`' destinations should be chosen randomly or if you want to choose them yourself.
+
Using btn:[Create orders randomly], you define the number of transport orders that are to be generated at a time, and the number of destinations a single transport order should contain.
Since the destinations will be selected randomly, the orders created might not necessarily make sense for a real-world system.
+
Using btn:[Create orders according to definition], you can define an arbitrary number of transport orders, each with an arbitrary number of destinations and properties, and save and load your list of transport orders.
. Start the order generator by activating the corresponding checkbox at the bottom of the btn:[Continuous load] panel.
The load generator will then generate transport orders according to its configuration until the checkbox is deactivated or the panel is closed.

==== Statistics reports about transport orders and vehicles

While running in plant operation mode, the openTCS kernel collects data about processed, finished and failed transport orders as well as busy and idle vehicles.
It writes this data to log files in the `log/statistics/` subdirectory.
To see a basic statistics report for the order processing in a plant operation session, you can use another plugin for the plant overview client that comes with the openTCS distribution:

. In the plant overview client, select btn:[menu:View[Plugins > Statistics]] from the menu.
. Click the btn:[Read input file] button and select a log file from `log/statistics/` in the kernel application's directory.
. The panel will then show an accumulation of the data collected in the statistics log file you opened.

NOTE: As the steps above should indicate, the statistics plugin currently does not provide a live view on statistical data in a running plant operation session.
The report is an offline report that can be generated only after a plant operation session has ended.
Future versions of openTCS may include a live report plugin that collects data directly from the openTCS kernel instead of reading the data from a log file.

==== Removing a vehicle from a running system

There may be situations in which you want to remove a single vehicle from a system, e.g. because the vehicle temporarily cannot be controlled by openTCS due to a hardware defect that has to be dealt with first.
The following steps will ensure that no further transport orders are assigned to the vehicle and that the resources it might still be occupying are freed for use by other vehicles.

. In the plant overview client, right-click on the vehicle and select btn:[menu:Context menu[Change integration level > ...to ignore this vehicle]] to disable the vehicle for transport order processing and to free the point in the driving course that the vehicle is occupying.
. In the kernel control center client, disable the vehicle's driver by unticking the checkbox btn:[Enable loopback adapter] in the btn:[Loopback options] tab or the checkbox in the btn:[Enabled?] column of the vehicle list.
