== Configuring openTCS

=== Application language

By default, all openTCS applications with user interfaces display texts in English language.
The applications are prepared for internationalization, though, and can be configured to display texts in a different language, provided there is a translation for it.
The openTCS distribution comes with the default (English) language and a German translation.
Additional translations can be integrated -- how this is done is described in the Developer's Guide.

For setting the language, each application has a configuration entry that needs to be set to a _language tag_ for the language to use.
(See <<Kernel Control Center application configuration entries>> and <<Plant Overview application configuration entries>>.)
Examples for language tags are:

* "en" for English
* "de" for German
* "no" for Norwegian
* "zh" for Chinese

By default, the configuration entries are set to "en", resulting in English texts.
Since a German translation is included, you can switch e.g. the Plant Overview to German by setting its `locale` configuration entry to "de".
(Note that the application needs to be restarted for this.)

Configuring an application to use a language for which there is no translation will result in the default (English) language to be used.

=== Kernel configuration

The kernel application reads its configuration data from the following files:

. `config/opentcs-kernel-defaults-baseline.properties`,
. `config/opentcs-kernel-defaults-custom.properties` and
. `config/opentcs-kernel.properties`.

The files are read in this order, and configuration values set in one file can be overridden in any subsequent one.
For users, it is recommended to leave the first two files untouched and set overriding values and project-specific configuration data in `opentcs-kernel.properties` only.

==== Kernel application configuration entries

The kernel application itself can be configured using the following configuration entries:

include::{configdoc}/KernelApplicationConfigurationEntries.adoc[]

=== Kernel Control Center configuration

The kernel control center application reads its configuration data from the following files:

. `config/opentcs-kernelcontrolcenter-defaults-baseline.properties`,
. `config/opentcs-kernelcontrolcenter-defaults-custom.properties` and
. `config/opentcs-kernelcontrolcenter.properties`.

The files are read in this order, and configuration values set in one file can be overridden in any subsequent one.
For users, it is recommended to leave the first two files untouched and set overriding values and project-specific configuration data in `opentcs-kernelcontrolcenter.properties` only.

==== Kernel Control Center application configuration entries

The kernel control center application itself can be configured using the following configuration entries:

include::{configdoc}/KernelControlCenterApplicationConfigurationEntries.adoc[]

=== Plant Overview configuration

The plant overview application reads its configuration data from the following files:

. `config/opentcs-plantoverview-defaults-baseline.properties`,
. `config/opentcs-plantoverview-defaults-custom.properties`,

The files are read in this order, and configuration values set in one file can be overridden in any subsequent one.
For users, it is recommended to leave the first two files untouched and set overriding values and project-specific configuration data in `opentcs-plantoverview.properties` only.

==== Plant Overview application configuration entries
