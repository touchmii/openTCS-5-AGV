== Customizing and extending the plant overview application

=== Guice modules

Analogous to the kernel application, the plant overview application uses Guice to configure its components.
To modify the wiring of components within the application and to add your own components, you can register custom Guice modules.
Modules are found and registered automatically via `java.util.ServiceLoader`.

Basically, the following steps are required for customizing the application:

. Build a JAR file for your custom injection module with the following content:
.. A subclass of `PlantOverviewInjectionModule`, which can be found in the base library, must be contained.
Configure your custom components or adjust the application's default wiring in this module.
`PlantOverviewInjectionModule` provides a few supporting methods you can use.
.. A plain text file named `META-INF/services/org.opentcs.customizations.plantoverview.PlantOverviewInjectionModule` must also be contained.
This file should contain a single line of text with the fully qualified class name of your module.
. Ensure that the JAR file(s) containing your Guice modules and the implementation of your custom component(s) are part of the class path when you start the plant overview application.

For more information on how the automatic registration works, see the documentation of `java.util.ServiceLoader` in the Java class library.
For more information on how Guice works, see the Guice documentation.

=== How to create a plugin panel for the plant overview client

The plant overview client offers to integrate custom panels providing project-specific functionality.

. Implement a subclass of `PluggablePanel`.
. Implement a `PluggablePanelFactory` that produces instances of your `PluggablePanel`.
. Create a Guice module for your `PluggablePanelFactory` by subclassing `PlantOverviewInjectionModule`.
Implement the `configure()` method and add a binding to your `PluggablePanelFactory` using `pluggablePanelFactoryBinder()`.
For example, the load generator panel that is part of the openTCS distribution is registered with the following line in its module's `configure()` method:
+
[source, java]
----
include::{loadGeneratorPanel-guiceSrc}/org/opentcs/guing/plugins/panels/loadgenerator/LoadGeneratorPanelModule.java[tags=documentation_createPluginPanelModule]
----

. Build and package the `PluggablePanel`, `PluggablePanelFactory` and Guice module into a JAR file.
. In the JAR file, register the Guice module class as a service of type `PlantOverviewInjectionModule`.
To do that, ensure that the JAR file contains a folder named `META-INF/services/` with a file named `org.opentcs.customizations.plantoverview.PlantOverviewInjectionModule`.
This file should consist of a single line of text holding simply the name of the guice module class, e.g.:
+
[source]
----
org.opentcs.guing.plugins.panels.loadgenerator.LoadGeneratorPanelModule
----

. Place the JAR file in the Plant Overview application's class path (subdirectory `lib/openTCS-extensions/` of the application's installation directory) and start the application.

=== How to create a location/vehicle theme for openTCS

Locations and vehicles are visualized in the plant overview client using configurable themes.
To customize the appearance of locations and vehicles, new theme implementations can be created and integrated into the plant overview client.

. Create a new class which implements `LocationTheme` or `VehicleTheme`.
. Place the JAR file of your theme, containing all required resources, in the subdirectory `lib/openTCS-extensions/` of the openTCS plant overview application's installation directory _before_ the application is started.
(The openTCS start scripts include all JAR files in that directory in the application's classpath.)
. Set the `locationThemeClass` or `vehicleThemeClass` in the Plant Overview application's configuration file.

Vehicles or locations in plant models are then rendered using your custom theme.
